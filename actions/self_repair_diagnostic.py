Evidence supplied by user:\n{evidence or '(none)'}

NON-NEGOTIABLE ARCHITECTURE INVARIANTS:
- Server is headless: no server microphone, speaker, voice UI, or interactive CLI.
- Device-local commands default to the originating companion unless the user explicitly targets another device/server.
- origin_device_id controls command routing; active_voice_device controls interactive audio. Never merge them.
- Voice/TTS is emitted only by the companion and returns to the originating voice companion.
- Android, Windows, Linux and macOS companion capabilities must not be silently removed.
- Pairing must continue to support remote/off-LAN use.
- Do not add background polling, news, briefing, time announcements, or schedules unless explicitly requested.
- Preserve unrelated behavior. Patch only the root cause.

STRICT DRY-RUN RULES:
- Diagnose only. Do not claim anything was applied.
- Do not propose deletion of source files.
- Do not modify credentials, .git, certificates, secrets, or self-repair files.
- There is no arbitrary file-count limit for inspection or a legitimate cross-module proposed repair.
- Follow the complete relevant dependency path before concluding.
- Prefer the smallest root-cause patch.
