# MARK-LIV current patch notes

This file replaces the obsolete notes for the former GUI/CLI/background architecture.

## Current baseline

- Headless server lifecycle with `--start`, `--stop`, `--enable`, `--disable`, and `--pair`.
- Native Android and Windows/Linux/macOS companions are the interaction surfaces.
- Interactive voice is companion-only; the server never plays local TTS.
- Origin-first routing sends device-local actions back to the companion that originated the turn unless another target is explicit.
- `origin_device_id` and `active_voice_device` are independent state.
- Paired-device name resolution prefers the online matching record and canonical device UUID.
- Android Accessibility UI automation supports inspect/click/text/scroll/global actions and uses inspect/act/verify recovery.
- Gemini Live transport/session rollover preserves active conversation context.
- News, time, and briefings are on-demand by default.
- User-created recurring workflows persist and execute only when authorized by the user.
- Self-repair is currently Diagnostic/Dry-Run only: read-only, dependency-aware, and without an arbitrary total file-count limit.

## Self-repair safety

Diagnostic mode can inspect the full relevant dependency path and propose a root-cause patch. It cannot modify/delete source, install dependencies, restart the service, or mutate Git. Production apply/rollback is intentionally not enabled yet.

## Validation expected for release packages

At minimum, compile changed Python modules with `python -m py_compile` and run ZIP integrity verification after packaging. Android/desktop source should only be reported as changed when its files actually differ; Android build success must not be claimed unless Gradle was actually run.

## v26 — conversational self-repair activation

- A vague error observation no longer authorizes `self_repair_diagnostic` automatically.
- JARVIS must acknowledge the issue and obtain a concrete symptom plus explicit diagnose/check/debug/repair intent before starting the read-only diagnostic.
- `main.py` enforces the activation rule in code as a backstop, so an accidental model tool call is rejected safely and returned to conversation instead of starting diagnosis.
- Diagnostic mode remains read-only with no apply/edit/delete/install/restart/Git capability.


### v27 runtime stability
- Headless server does not emit unsolicited CPU/RAM voice alerts; system status remains available on demand.
- Gemini side/diagnostic calls no longer open extra Live sessions that can consume Live quota or destabilize the interactive companion voice session.
- Removed retired pinned `gemini-2.5-flash` / `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` fallback names in favor of maintained rolling aliases.
- WebSocket keepalive/close timeouts are treated as transport rollover: conversation context is preserved and the server reconnects quietly.
- Diagnostic self-repair remains read-only and still requires explicit, concrete user diagnostic intent.
