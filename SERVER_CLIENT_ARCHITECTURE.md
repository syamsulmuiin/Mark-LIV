# MARK-LIV server / companion architecture

This document describes the current architecture. Historical GUI/CLI/background runtime modes are obsolete and are not supported server access surfaces.

## Headless server

The server owns Gemini Live orchestration, trusted-device routing, persistence/scheduling, server-side actions, and HTTP/WebSocket transport. It has no local microphone, speaker, conversational CLI, or desktop GUI.

Public administrative interface:

```text
python main.py --start
python main.py --stop
python main.py --enable
python main.py --disable
python main.py --pair
```

`--server-worker` is an internal lifecycle flag.

## Companions

Android and desktop companions are the user-facing control/execution surfaces. Voice input/output is companion-only. Desktop companions carry the established local action runtime; Android exposes Android-native capabilities and optional Accessibility UI automation.

## Origin-first routing

Every companion-originated turn has an origin device identity. Unless the user explicitly names another target, device-local actions execute on that origin companion.

Two states must remain separate:

- `origin_device_id`: execution target for the current turn.
- `active_voice_device`: interactive audio destination.

`call_current_device` uses the turn origin. `call_paired_device` is for another explicitly targeted paired device. Device-name resolution prefers an online matching record and should resolve to the canonical paired UUID.

## Voice lifecycle

The server receives/forwards live-session audio but does not render audio. Interactive audio returns to the active voice companion. Command routing must never clear or repurpose voice state. Gemini session rollover/reconnect should preserve active conversational context rather than treating transport rollover as a completed conversation.

## Device mesh and pairing

Paired devices use Ed25519 identities, signed challenge/response, and explicit capabilities. Pairing is available through the configured remote endpoint (`https://auth.kasirdigital.web.id`) and supported local transport. `--pair` creates a short-lived Pair Code on an already-running server.

Cloudflare transport does not replace application-level device authentication or capability authorization.

## Android UI execution

Android Accessibility is opt-in. UI automation follows `inspect -> act -> verify/recover`. Blind scrolling/clicking is not the default strategy. A failed UI operation is not evidence by itself that Internet connectivity or Accessibility is unavailable.

## Scheduling/background behavior

There is no default morning briefing, news poll, or time announcement. News/time are fetched on demand. The scheduler exists to execute workflows explicitly created by the user. Recurring workflow state is stored under `~/.jarvis/scheduled_workflows.json`.

## Read-only self repair

Diagnostic self-repair is user-initiated and conversational first: a vague error observation does not trigger it. JARVIS obtains a concrete symptom and explicit diagnostic/repair intent, announces the read-only diagnostic, and only then starts inspection. A code-level activation guard rejects accidental generic calls. Once authorized, diagnostic self-repair may traverse the complete relevant dependency path without a fixed total file limit. It cannot apply edits, delete source, install packages, restart services, or perform Git mutations. Architecture invariants above are part of its diagnostic safety boundary.


### v27 runtime stability
- Headless server does not emit unsolicited CPU/RAM voice alerts; system status remains available on demand.
- Gemini side/diagnostic calls no longer open extra Live sessions that can consume Live quota or destabilize the interactive companion voice session.
- Removed retired pinned `gemini-2.5-flash` / `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` fallback names in favor of maintained rolling aliases.
- WebSocket keepalive/close timeouts are treated as transport rollover: conversation context is preserved and the server reconnects quietly.
- Diagnostic self-repair remains read-only and still requires explicit, concrete user diagnostic intent.

## Runtime module boundaries

`main.py` remains the Live conversation orchestrator. Headless process lifecycle is isolated in `core/server_lifecycle.py`; Live-bound tool schemas are isolated in `core/live_tools.py`; model selection is centralized in `core/model_config.py`; and bounded worker stdout/stderr rotation is handled by `core/runtime_log.py`. This separation is structural only and does not move voice or device execution back onto the server.

### v32 network configuration centralization
Network endpoints and ports now use `core/network_config.py` as the server source of truth. Defaults remain unchanged, but deployments can override them with `MARK_LIV_PUBLIC_HOSTNAME`, `MARK_LIV_DASHBOARD_PORT`, `MARK_LIV_LAN_HTTPS_PORT`, `MARK_LIV_DISCOVERY_PORT`, and `MARK_LIV_LOCAL_HOST`, or `config/network.json`. The standalone desktop runtime carries the same config module. Android uses `BuildConfig.MARK_LIV_PUBLIC_URL`, set at APK build time from `MARK_LIV_PUBLIC_URL`, so the public endpoint is no longer duplicated in Kotlin.


## Default network configuration
Server deployment endpoints and ports are edited in `config/network.json`. The desktop companion standalone runtime mirrors the same defaults in `desktop-companion/runtime/config/network.json`. Environment variables are optional deployment overrides; if absent, the JSON values are used, with built-in constants retained only as final safety defaults.


## Headless server boundary

The server does not enumerate or open microphone/speaker devices and does not depend on a desktop GUI toolkit. Companion clients own local audio capture, playback, and user-interface presentation. The server may process PCM data received from companions, but that does not require local audio hardware.


## Language compatibility boundary

Project-facing documentation, comments, prompts, logs, UI text, and examples are English-only. Multilingual input aliases required for natural-language compatibility are isolated from orchestration code in `core/language_compat.py`. This keeps the project text consistent without removing the ability to understand supported non-English commands.

## Headless installation boundary

The root Python environment is the server environment. It must not require a display server, local microphone/speaker stack, camera, screen capture, keyboard/mouse automation, or desktop window APIs. Those dependencies belong to desktop companions. Linux server setup uses a project-local virtual environment when necessary so Debian-family distributions, including Armbian, are not forced to modify an externally managed system Python.

Server-side Playwright automation is an optional extra and is not part of the base headless installation. This keeps ARM deployments independent from browser-binary availability.


## Operation-aware origin routing

Companion-originated requests preserve the origin device as the execution target for local UI and device operations. Pure backend computation can still run on the server. Mixed actions are classified by operation so a backend helper does not accidentally open, type, click, launch, or update something on the headless server. Device-local execution must continue through `call_current_device`.


## Autonomous companion UI execution

A companion is responsible for completing normal UI workflows on its own device. JARVIS uses an inspect -> act -> verify loop instead of asking the user to position a cursor or manually navigate ordinary application UI. If a target is not visible, JARVIS can inspect, scroll, navigate, search, type ordinary text, select controls, and re-inspect until the requested state is reached.

Automation pauses only at the credential boundary (PIN/password/passcode/authentication) or when the companion genuinely lacks a required capability. After authentication is completed by the user, JARVIS re-inspects the existing session and resumes the unfinished task.

## Application-agnostic device automation

Device automation is capability-driven rather than application-driven. Application/package names and domain values are target data only. The companion exposes generic primitives for launch/close, UI inspection, click/tap, ordinary text entry, scrolling, supported global navigation, and verification.

The same inspect -> act -> verify loop applies to every application, including applications installed after MARK-LIV was built. Legacy actions may perform backend computation but do not define companion UI behavior. Credential/authentication input remains the intentional user-intervention boundary apart from a genuinely unavailable capability.

## Conversation lifecycle versus server lifecycle

Conversation lifecycle and server lifecycle are separate. Ending or closing a conversation only completes the current conversational session; it does not stop the JARVIS process, server, remote access, or paired companions. Server shutdown is a separate privileged lifecycle action and is selected only from explicit server/service shutdown intent.

## Documentation synchronization status

This document describes the current server/companion architecture. The root `readme.md` is the operational entry point and `PATCH_NOTES.md` is the version history. Current invariants are: headless server; companion-only conversational audio; origin-first routing; application-agnostic inspect -> act -> verify device automation; credential input protection; conversation lifecycle separate from server lifecycle; explicit-only scheduling; and no claim of full cross-device file sharing until a common transfer protocol exists across companions.
